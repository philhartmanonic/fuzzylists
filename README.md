# fuzzylists

Some ad hoc scripting to do some fuzzy matching between two large lists.

I did most of this in jupyter console, as the goal was getting CSVs, not creating something replicatable.

Also, as a heads up, in case you want to use this, there are a few points that take a long time (one took about 14 hours or so).
